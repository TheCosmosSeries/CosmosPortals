# Cosmos Portals
Due to having a similiar idea to XCompWiz's Mystcraft Portals, I have created Cosmos Portals, a small mod that adds configurable Portals to Minecraft. 

Currently supporting **1.21.1** and **NeoForge**.

### Description
Cosmos Portals is a simple mod that allows you to create Portals to any Dimension, so long as you can visit that Dimension first. You can even use it to travel between places in the same dimension!

Introducing customizable Portal colours and names, as well as a 4-in-1 Portal Dock to hot-swap multiple locations from a single location. Combine a Portal Dock with a Portal Controller and swap Portals with a simple button click!

You can also filter portals for specific entities, allowing player-only portals, mob-only portals or even item-only portals!
